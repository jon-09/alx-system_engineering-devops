1. There are currently two servers. Each server has a separate codebase, database, web server,
    and application server. If there is a lot of traffic if the other server fails, it will be useful. A HA proxy-
    loadbalancer is also present. The traffic will be split between the two servers as a result.

2. The two options are Weighted round robin, in which each server is given a weight and the one with the highest
    weight receives more requests, or Weighted least connection, in which each server is given a weight and requests are
    routed to the one with the fewest connections.
3. It employs Active-Active, so if a server ever fails, requests aren't forwarded to it until after a health check, at which
    point another server takes over. It can also use           active-passive, which means that if the active server ever fails,
    the passive will immediately take over until the other one recovers.

4. A primary source server (or node) that is permitted to host a read/write availability database is the primary replica. The
    server that keeps a complete backup copy of the original  server and hosts read-only availability databases is known as a secondary
    replica. During a failover, whether they are in synchronized or asynchronous mode, the secondary replica takes on the primary role with
    or without a guarantee of data protection, and when the primary replica becomes available, it takes over.

Issues with the infrastructure:
1. SPOF still only has one client connected to the network. If these two servers are housed in the same datacenter and use the same power
    supply there, that poses another problem.
2. Security concerns persist. Since data is being transferred without being encrypted, it is not using HTTP, which is insecure. Since
    there is no firewall, every incoming traffic can access the data.
3. There is no monitoring being done, thus we are unable to determine whether our website is up and running quickly, returning errors
    frequently, or responding to monitoring requests.
