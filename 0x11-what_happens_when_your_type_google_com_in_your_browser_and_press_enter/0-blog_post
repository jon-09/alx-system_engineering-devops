AWEBSITE
A webpage is just a text file with special formatting applied so that it can be read by your browser (such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.). The Hyper Text Markup Language is the term for this design (HTML). Until someone requests access to them, web pages are kept on servers that provide the storage service. These devices are known as servers. This is because they make their content accessible to anyone who requires it.
